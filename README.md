# Wes Bos JavaScript30 - Challenge 24

In this challenge we are exploring the nav element.

This project illustrates how to create a sticky nav that will  
always remain on the top of the page.

Features:  
* Nav bar will always remain visible on the top of the page.
* There's an animation that slides in from the left side once  
scrolled past the top height of the Nav bar on the page.
